cast in the glow as your flames roll over
i console myself, a kindness you cannot betray
i am beside myself, all smoke and smolder

with all those other folks who you knocked over
all soot and shadows melting in the rain
cast in the glow as your flames roll over

growing jaded, growing colder
watching all the bridges set aflame
i am beside myself, all smoke and smolder

watching bridges lighting your way forward
no kinder kindling, just disdain
cast in the glow as your flames roll over

beaten bitter, fireproof, and a few years older
carving some new future out of all this jade
i am beside myself, all smoke and smolder

my own on hand upon my shoulder
as i stand beside myself with all the others razed
cast in the glow as your flames roll over
i am beside myself, all smoke and smolder
