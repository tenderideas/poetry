we seemed pretty sure
we swore ancestral and haught-
-y, we talked up a storm,
plunged pupils first and for what?

to storytell pains from afar?
to be thought thoughtful and forgiven?
did our viscera ever look nice up against the wall
splayed silently so the world could hear our misgivings?

which delirium depends
and our current shade of flesh
can’t decide whether to fend
off distraught limits or take off the edge

as we prance across minefields
tiptoeing our very best
we reread the spelt blood of years past
and smile at pains from past fears

i looking down at all you've done,
you looking up, naive and dated,
i'm mad but i'm you in sum
of course i understand, foretold and forefated

so untighten your fist and unclench yourself vulnerable;
there’s no nobility in pretending you’re not hurt.
whatever it was you felt today i get it, raw and subtle.
i remember feeling all of it like fingers in the dirt.

every hero you might have one day felt this way
and no cause ever lacked a holy worrier
painters out of paint, and you run out of things to say
no matter what it was today, someone fucked it up earlier

so call up old friends and smugly request
help sorting through the blood lint of a ditsy sage
and they loyal saints help us fragile find some rest
while you and i read each other through time and page.
