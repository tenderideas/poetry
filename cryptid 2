confabula rasa (or cryptid 2)
i want a fog of war over my mind
i wanna scramble my radar
a muggy uncertainty to cover the strife
of the codebreakers working ‘til late. they’re
on the hunt for a mythical beast,
some top secret government cryptid,
a puerile critter from deep rooted dreams
who whispers me malice insipid.
who fades outta sight when brought into view,
who’s shadows keep lookouts quite busy,
who’s nightmare trail breadcrumbs lead far from the truth,
who’s midnight songs ring out of pitch, he
never makes a makes a sound but always leaves an echo
of soft static in the corner of my ear.
who leaves me odd gifts, foreseen select woes,
whenever i got bigger fears to fear.
who points to the holster on an officer’s belt
says “wouldn’t that fit good in your palm?”
what are the words to make today a livin’ hell?
on planes he just chants the word “bomb”.
and i do apologize, it’s all i ever do.
sorry seared a righteous brand.
apologize for things i never said come true.
hunting the apocalypse apology in hand.
so i find myself a torch and i clench into the night
and don’t rest until i’ve lit myself aflame.
and search for this fiend in every corner of my mind
until tired i do restlessly proclaim:
once upon a time we slew monsters
but these days they seem to stick around
and if i am to live with you forever after
i cannot fight you round and round
‘cuz you hate to sit still
you hate takin’ fire
you hoard it until
i calmly conspire
to drown you in a lack of intel
to rudely interrupt the hunt
to admit i cannot foretell 
tomorrow. no more catastrophe grunts.
i am built for thinner wars
and more realer threats
then your bloodcurdlin’ glare
your neverhaveiever regrets.
so i shut down the searchlights,
and quit lookin’ for your shakin’ caress.
if you will haunt me, do it quiet.
tonight i’d like to get some rest.
