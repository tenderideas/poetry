despite the fact that in this tongue
my vague tone might pass for neutral
here in Gringolandia - in spanish
i’ll be heard as from… elsewhere.

with my ce’s ci’s and z’s
alisped i can’t downplay the spaniard
part. sounds that made the other
latino kids implore i say:
“corazón” and “raza”. smiles
besmirked. but at the umbral base
of my speech lies a sing-
songiness of distant mixt-
-icism only audible
to a spaniard’s ear.

foreign
at first listen. i must be
from somewhere else.

    an otherness
lives within that fog. unseen
palpable like headphones yanked,
caught on a nail you don’t remem-
-ber hammering into the wall.

it sneaks up on me, what i
inherit in my speech. who’s broken
bones are these?
    my accent comes with
its own vocabulary. words
entrenched at dinner. gaps
that show up when on the phone.
there’s no doubt a word for white
supremacist in spanish, but
i never felt the need to look
it up. english will do within
that sentence.
    borrowed words, and ang-
-licisms, turns of phrase that only
flow in Spain, and others only
in South Florida.
i’m afraid
to ever visit Cuba. not
because of politics but just
because i don’t think anyone
would believe i’m cuban.
i
am not half cuban. fractions do
not run within my veins. percent-
-ages don’t myelinate my axons.
family trees do not tell tales
of exile. when a family leaves,
is there a word for grandkids who
sit with the idea of
returning to a place that only 
exists within the memories
that the abuelos embellished, or hid?


i know well there’s a whole generation
stuck in Cuba, 1959 and i try to unstring
their politics from the thread of their pain
so i could hold their trauma in my arms
and compare it to whatever was sewn
into my own psyche. how much brokenness
still stands broken a few generations later.
so have i yet earned permission
to claim my origin?
or will i still be shirked, foreign,
for being heir to the wrong phonemes?
who’s broken bones are these?

there aren’t many spaniards out here.
but i’ve met a lot of latin folks
who’s accent keeps them from
speaking their mother tongue.
someone once told me we hispanics
have to stop apologizing for not
being hispanic enough. the word
diaspora exists for a reason.
this is who we are. piecing together
in the fog the stories,
trauma, lives we inherit.
