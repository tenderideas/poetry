I want a fog of war over my love life
I wanna scramble my radar
a muggy uncertainty to smother the strife
of the codebreakers working ‘til late, they're

on the hunt for a mythical beast
some top secret government cryptid
a puerile critter from deep rooted dreams
who whispers me malice insipid,

and fades out of sight when brought into view
but screams static in the corner of my ears
whose bloodcurdling glare shines tolerable hues
only when viewed through the lens of your fears

who hates to sit still
and hates taking fire
but hoards it until
i calmly conspire

to trust you know not to hurt me,
won’t desert me

i am built for thinner wars
and more palpable threats
than jealousy’s protracted dark tremble
so shut down the searchlights
i’ll drop my guard and rest.
i will see this disassembled.
